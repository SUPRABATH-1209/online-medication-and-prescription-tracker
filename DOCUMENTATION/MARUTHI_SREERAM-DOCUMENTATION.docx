ONLINE MEDICATION & PRESCRIPTION TRACKER

1. Introduction

Healthcare systems often face challenges in tracking patient medication adherence and managing prescriptions efficiently. Patients may forget to take medicines on time, while doctors lack visibility into whether prescriptions are being followed correctly.

The Online Medication & Prescription Tracker is a role-based web application designed to solve this problem by enabling doctors to prescribe medications digitally, patients to receive reminders and update intake status, and administrators to manage and monitor the system.

2. Objectives of the Project

The primary objectives of this project are:

To digitize prescription management

To help patients follow medication schedules accurately

To provide doctors real-time visibility of patient medication adherence

To ensure secure role-based access using authentication and authorization

To build a scalable and industry-ready full stack application

3. Scope of the Project

This system supports three types of users:

Doctors

Patients

Administrators

Each user has a dedicated dashboard and features based on their role. The system focuses on structured medical data storage and secure communication between frontend and backend.

4. Technology Stack
Frontend Technologies

React (Vite)

React Router

Axios

HTML, CSS (simple and clean UI)

Backend Technologies

Java 17

Spring Boot 3

Spring Security

JWT Authentication

RESTful Web Services

Database

MySQL (Relational Database)

5. System Architecture

The application follows a client–server architecture:

The frontend handles user interaction and sends requests to backend APIs.

The backend processes requests, applies business logic, and communicates with the database.

Authentication is handled using JWT tokens.

Role-based authorization ensures secure access.

6. User Roles and Functionalities
6.1 Doctor Module

After login, a doctor can:

Complete their professional profile (specialization, hospital, experience)

View assigned patients

Create prescriptions for patients

Add medicines with dosage, frequency, and duration

Automatically generate medication schedules

Monitor patient medication intake status:

DONE

PENDING

MISSED

6.2 Patient Module

After login, a patient can:

View assigned doctor(s)

View prescriptions

View daily medication reminders

Mark medicines as DONE after intake

Automatically update medication status visible to the doctor

6.3 Admin Module

The administrator can:

Login securely

Verify doctor accounts

View basic system statistics

Monitor platform usage

7. Authentication and Authorization Flow

Users register using a common registration form

Users select their role during registration

Login generates a JWT token

Token is used for secure API communication

Role-based dashboard redirection is applied

Unauthorized access is restricted using Spring Security

8. Functional Workflow
Doctor Workflow

Login to system

Complete profile

Select patient

Create prescription

Add medicines and schedule

Track patient adherence

Patient Workflow

Login to system

View prescriptions

Receive medication reminders

Mark medicines as taken

Admin Workflow

Login

Verify doctors

View statistics

9. Database Design Overview

The database is designed using relational concepts with structured tables for:

Users

Doctors

Patients

Prescriptions

Medications

Medication Schedules

Foreign key relationships are used to maintain data integrity.

10. Medication Status Logic

All medicines are initially marked as PENDING

When patient marks medicine intake, status becomes DONE

If a medicine is not marked within the scheduled day, it is automatically marked as MISSED

11. Frontend Features

Responsive role-based dashboards

Secure login and registration

Medication reminder interface

Real-time status updates

Clean and user-friendly UI

12. Backend Features

Layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)

Secure REST APIs

JWT-based authentication

Role-based authorization

Structured database interaction

13. Future Enhancements

AI-based medication adherence prediction

Smart reminders using patient behavior

Health analytics dashboard

Integration with wearable devices

Emergency alert system

14. Advantages of the System

Reduces medication errors

Improves patient adherence

Provides transparency to doctors

Enhances healthcare efficiency

Secure and scalable architecture

15. Conclusion

The Online Medication & Prescription Tracker is a real-world healthcare solution that demonstrates the practical implementation of full stack development using modern technologies. The system ensures security, scalability, and usability, making it suitable for real-time healthcare applications.
