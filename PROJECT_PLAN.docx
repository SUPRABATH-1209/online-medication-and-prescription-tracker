Online Medication & Prescription Tracker
Problem Statement
In today’s fast-paced world, managing healthcare efficiently has become a major challenge. Patients often struggle to keep track of doctor consultations, prescriptions, and medication schedules. Visiting clinics frequently for routine consultations, getting prescriptions, and remembering medication timing can be inconvenient and time-consuming.
Existing digital healthcare platforms, such as Practo, allow users to consult doctors online, book lab tests, and manage appointments. However, these platforms primarily focus on general healthcare services and online consultations, and managing prescriptions and medications remains fragmented. There is a need for a dedicated solution that allows users to store, track, and manage their prescriptions and medications in a systematic way.
The Online Medication & Prescription Tracker aims to provide a digital solution for prescription management, helping users:
1.	Store prescriptions digitally – Users can upload prescriptions from any doctor or clinic.
2.	Track medication schedules – Set reminders for medicine intake to avoid missed doses.
3.	Monitor medical history – Maintain a history of consultations, tests, and treatments.
4.	Access healthcare information – Quickly view past prescriptions and notes from doctors.
This system will improve patient convenience, reduce errors in medication intake, and provide a centralized platform for personal health records. It will benefit users who need regular medical care, those with chronic illnesses, or anyone who wants to maintain organized health records digitally.
By combining digital prescription tracking, medication reminders, and doctor consultation records, the project aims to make healthcare management easier, safer, and more reliable for users.
